<p><b> MiNT </b> is a preemtive multitasking kernel. The major
differences between this and the TOS that is built into your Falcon
are:
<br>
</p>
<p>The <b> MiNT </b> kernel itself provides the ability to load
several programs into memeory and give them each a 'timeslice' of
processor time. These timeslices 'cycle'. In many cases (using a
utility called nice) you can even set priorities for which program(s)
should get more CPU time. With some know-how, you can also get really
fancy with MiNT and make it a multi user system that designates a
maximum amout of RAM and processor time that particular users can use,
and that applications can grab for themselves.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> MiNT </b> also allows various drivers and plugins to be
booted with the kernel. For instance...one can install MiNT-Net
sockets, device drivers, or the intellegent bits to deal with various
hard disk partitions (such as EXT2). Common drivers are PPP, Plip,
ext2, minix, serial devices, alternate consoles, mouse drivers,
ethernet boards, virtual consoles, and more.
</p>
<p><b> MiNT </b>is as POSIX compatable as possible. This is mostly
of interest to those who program, or wish to compile standard ANSI C
sources (usually written with unix based machines in mind). This means
that given the right compiler and libraries, one can compile a
plethora of code targeted to unix (the hardware itself doesn't
matter). One example is the ability to download sources for something
like IRC (<a href="15.htm" target="UDOcon">Internet</a> Relay Chat), Pine (Email and News Group clinet), or
TinyFugue (A glorified telnet client designed for text based multi
user games/chats) from the net and compile it right away with few to
no changes to the code.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> MiNT </b> is just the base of things and in and of itself
only supports basic disk operation and vt52 screen manipulation.
<br>
</p>
<p>Other aspects of a complete MiNT setup include the AES, and the
GEM routines. This is the part of your Atari OS that invloves drawing
and manipulating windows, icons, dialogues, and dealing with the data
inside them.
<br>
</p>
<p>One Example is the GEM/AES that is built into the Falcon. You see
it almost immediately when you boot up your Falcon upon the desk-top.
The built in GEM/AES/<a href="030505.htm" target="UDOcon">Desktop</a> of the Falcon can indeed run with MiNT,
but, it lacks the ability to launch more than one application, and
also has limits as to how many windows can be open at once, etc.
<br>
<br>Notice, when you installed MultiTOS...
<br>You put a file called mint.prg into the auto folder.
<br>You put a file called MINT.CNF into a folder called MULTITOS or
MINT.
<br>You put a file called GEM.SYS into a folder called MULTITOS or
MINT.
<br>You put a file called GEM.CNF into a folder called MULTITOS or
MINT.
<br>
<br>mint.prg is the kernel.
<br>MINT.CNF is a text file that sets userdefined parts of MINT.
<br>GEM.SYS is the GEM/AES/<a href="030505.htm" target="UDOcon">Desktop</a> part of things.
<br>GEM.CNF is a text file that sets userdefined parts of GEM, such as
paths and file extension information.
<br>
<br>Now, when you boot your Falcon, mint.prg is one of the first
things to load...and once all of your auto folder programs get loaded
it usually looks for GEM.SYS (you can address what mint will load, and
how it loads at boot-time inside the mint.cnf file). If mint.cnf does
not contain the line exec file.prg or gem file.prg, or these programs
don't exist as stated, it will load the built in GEM/AES/<a href="030505.htm" target="UDOcon">Desktop</a>.
<br>
</p>
<p>One common misconception about MiNT is that it requires a unix
partition and all sorts of complicated set-up files. This is not
entirely true. Really, it depends upon what you wish to do, the set of
tools you intend to use, and how important security is. The reason
most people go ahead and install a complete set of unix tools is
because so many clients and things already exist that were written
with unix in mind. I.E. The ncurses screen driver makes it a breeze
for a program to compile and not worry about if it should use VT52,
VT102, etc., or lynx can compile and use standard calls to MiNT-Net
for it's http access. Also, many of the already existing programs
intended for unix will want to check up on security issues with
files...like ownership and permission. It's easier to just install it
all than it is to try to strip out uneeded stuff.
<br>
</p>
<p>Since Atari released the commercial version of MultiTOS (shipped
with Falcons, and also sold seperately for ST use), Atari itself did
one major improvement to the GEM/AES/<a href="030505.htm" target="UDOcon">Desktop</a> part that eventaully made
it out to the FreeMiNT community. This is known as AES 4.1.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> AES 4.1 </b> does offer some advantages over the initial
MultiTOS release, thoe I can't name any from the top of my head. Most
of the improvements, if I recall correctly involve the AES part of
things. This is dealing with how GEM applications get multitasked and
windows and such are kept up with so the system doesn't get confused
about what GEM objects belong to what application(s).
</p>
<p>Since MultiTOS and AES4.1...
<br>Several improvements and enhancements have been made by others.
Geneva for instance, works with some mint kernels. It replaces the AES
and gives the Atari a new, faster, look and feel. N.AES (commercial)
was next on the scene with a more complete AES designed to properly
take advantage of more mint offerings. The latest AES replacement to
date is called XAAES and is free/opensource.
<br>
</p>
<p>All of these AES changes give GEM the ability to more properly and
efficently multitask GEM applications. They all give the system a
slightly different look and feel. One example of things you begin to
see with these newer AESes would be more gadgets in the windows, like
iconify, hide, or even the maclike ability to double click the top of
a window and see it shrink into something like a tool bar. The ability
to drag a window halfway off the left edge of a screen. Real time
window scrolling in the back ground. The ability to define what fonts
get used where and their sizes. Common pipes, and clipboard standards.
New file selectors that offer more options, and support for long
(fat32,ext2) filenames. The list goes on...but this should give you a
basic idea of what a multitasking GEM and AES is all about.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> The desktop. </b>
<br>MultiTOS and AES 4.1 both come with desktops that look and act
very similar to that built into the Falcon. The major difference being
the ability to launch more than one GEM application at one time.
Neither of these desktops recognize long filenames.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Geneva </b> , <b> N.AES </b>, and <b> XXAES </b> all treat
the desktop a bit differently. By default, they don't have one at all.
You define an alternate desktop that hopefully is multitasking
friendly. Or, you can run them without a desktop. Tara Desk is
free/opensource. It's a small and fast bare bones DeskTop, but is
reported to exist quite happily under MiNT as a multitasking aware
desktop. Thing is shareware, and is also packaged with N.AES (tho' the
version that comes with N.AES only works with N.AES). Jeenie is yet
another very powerful desk-top, commercial, that is reported to get
along very well with MiNT. NeoDesk and Ease aren't bad either, but
neither of these will notice long filenames, and have lagged behind in
some protocol advances such as the AVSERVER (a desktop protocol that
assists in having one program, or the desktop launch another and send
along instructions or pass files).
<br>
</p>
<p>The file selector is another thing to consider. The one that comes
with MultiTOS, AES 4.1, and Geneva is very basic, and is unable to
deal with long filenames. XXAES and N.AES both have newer, more
advanced file selectors. In any case, you can replace the file
selector with one of your choice, such as Freedom or BoxKite.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> GDOS </b> and the <b> VDI </b>
<br>This is a part of the Atari OS that deals with Screen draws,
fonts, and driving printers. GDOS can be used for other things as
well, but these are the most common uses.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> NVDI </b>is commecial, quite good and quite common. It speeds
up screen draws considerably, and can also support some graphics
cards. NVDI also has a GDOS that can use vector fonts on screen and
with your printer (Speedo, TrueType and Post Script).
<br>
</p>
<p><b> fVDI </b> (free/opensource) was initally intended to replace
the built in Atari VDI as a part of Dolmen. Dolmen was to be a new OS
streamlined and optimized for beefed up Falcons (CT2, CT060), Future
Falcon Clones, and other TOS machines like Hades and Medusa. Like
NVDI, fVDI is supposedly much more effecient at working with screen
draws. fVDI is REQUIRED to run some graphics cards, such as the ATI
RAGE PCI cards that can be installed with a Falcon BUS to PCI bridge.
fVDI is also more or less the new standard for opensource VDI work due
to the ARAnyM project which seeks to put TOS/GEM compatability on any
hardware platform. fVDI does not include GDOS. If you intend to use a
GDOS with fVDI, you can use the standard Atari one that does NOT
support variable sized vector fonts, or you can use the commercial
Speedo GDOS (Speedo, TrueType, PostScript), or the GDOS portion of
NVDI.
<br>
</p>
<p>A good VDI replacement is very much worthwhile in any Falcon
set-up. ESPECIALLY with MiNT. The machine feels MUCH faster!
<br>
</p>
<p>Music Applications and MiNT...
<br>Logic supposedly will work under MiNT, MagiC, or Geneva. I don't
own it, can't find it anywhere for sale, so can't try it personally :/
<br>
</p>
<p>CuBase doesn't like MiNT, and it doesn't like MagiC...I've never
gotten it to run under any MiNT/AES or MagiC variant myself.
Steinberg's own MROS task switcher doesn't work on my Falcon either.
So far, the only reliable task switcher I've found for the Falcon and
Steinberg music software is Geneva (without MiNT...thus a cooperative
multitasking switcher...works by system inturrupts as opposed to
preemtive time slice sharing like MiNT/MagiC or the Geneva-MiNT
combo).
<br>
</p>
<p>I haven't succeeded in getting Avalon to run on my Falcon, but
some users with a Dongle Switcher (Combiner, Mindex+, CartMaster) have
reported that if they launch CAF FIRST, press play then stop, and have
an STe sound emulator installed, they can at least get it working,
under single TOS or Geneva.
<br>
</p>
<p>Sample C works fine for me on all of my Ataris, under any OS.
<br>
</p>
<p>Zero-X supposedly will work under MiNT, tho' I don't have it yet
to try.
<br>
</p>
<p>Notator/Creator does not work at all on a Falcon.
<br>
</p>
<p>KCS Level II, Omega, Copiest, Band In A Box etc... I've not tried
these under MiNT, but because they frequently draw to SCREEN rather
than working with windows...I'd assume they'd be quite messy...if they
work at all. I have used these under Geneva however. Geneva allows you
to 'hold the screen' for the topped application. In some cases under
geneva, it's best to run the program in a 'single tasking mode' that
puts any other running application to sleep, and avoids issues of
screen droppings or other conflicts that may arise.
<br>
</p>
<p>There are boocoups of other MIDI apps out there...many free these
days. I haven't tested any but those listed above with MiNT. Give them
a try and let us know what happens ;)
