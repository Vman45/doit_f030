<p>I'm using a 16MHz MSTe M68000 as router to the <a href="15.htm" target="UDOcon">Internet</a> and there
is no major speed penalty having both the attaced pc and Stacy
downloading webpages at the same time.
<br>
</p>
<p>I just wrote a mail on how to set up a similar network. It's a bit
involved but I think it is correct:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes! As the TT has several serial ports it is well suited for
this. You should start with setting up Sting for LAN use.
<br>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>1. Decide ip addresses on your LAN:</b></dt><dd> TT: 192.168.1.1
<br>pc1: 192.168.1.2
<br>pc2: 192.168.1.3
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>2. Edit Sting's ROUTE.TAB to</b></dt><dd> 192.168.1.2 - 255.255.255.255 - Ser.2/LAN - 0.0.0.0
<br>192.168.1.3 - 255.255.255.255 - Modem 1 - 0.0.0.0
<br>0.0.0.0 - 0.0.0.0 - Masquerade - 0.0.0.0
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This is from my Mega STe so the port name Ser2/LAN will not be
present on the TT. You should use the exact spelling from the
&quot;Sting Port Setup&quot; CPX. Note that the modem port is not set
here as we are using masquerade.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>3. Open the CPX &quot;Sting Port Setup&quot;</b></dt><dd> For the two serial port in ROUTE.TAB set &quot;IP Adress&quot; to
192.168.1.1, MTU to 576 (1500 is default both in Sting and Win-95 and
will work fine locally but if your isp uses 576 you will get best
resluts with the lower value). Select Active for both ports and
preferably SLIP without compression (ppp will work too, but slower).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The serial port that is connected to your modem should NOT be
active! No IP address but with MTU=576 and ppp.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Select the &quot;Masquerade&quot; pseudo port IP address to
10.0.255.1 (default), MTU=576 and NOT active. Under
&quot;General&quot; select the serial port where your modem is
connected and &quot;Masking IP&quot; to 10.0.255.0 (default).
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>4. Open the Sting Dialer and select &quot;Configs&quot; - &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;.</b></dt><dd> Select the serial port where your modem is connected and select
&quot;Use IP Masquerading&quot;
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>5. Configure the Sting Dialer to conform to your isp's needs.</b></dt><dd> For a modern isp you will have to enter: MTU=576, PAP ID, PAP
password and select ppp in &quot;Port Parameters&quot;. User name
(account name), full name and domain name in &quot;Addressing&quot;.
Nameserver can be left blank. Full path for the file DIAL.SCR in
&quot;Miscellaneous&quot;. This is all you have to set if your isp
supports PAP. If you have managed to get your pc connected you'll know
what actual settings are needed.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>6. Install either HSMODA7 or FASTSERIAL and set port speeds etc.</b></dt><dd> I have had some problems with HSMODA7 on the TT but Fastserial
did it's job too.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>1. Win-95 side:</b></dt><dd> First you have to install a pseudo modem driver (MDMCBX4.INF) as
you will be using &quot;dial-up network&quot; (Or whatever it's
called, I only have the swedish terms at hand).
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>2. Win-95 side:</b></dt><dd> Install a new dial-up connection (your old one will still be
usable) and set it to uncompressed slip and fixed IP
address=192.168.1.2 (or 192.168.1.3). I think you must enter a valid
DNS address for the pc to resolve anything when online. Use your ISP's
DNS server.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>3. Win-95 side:</b></dt><dd> Set the serial port speed on the pc to same as Atari. No
handshaking needed. Try first with a low speed (19200). I have
problems with the SCC in my MSTe (needs a ESCC) and get lots of errors
at higher speeds. (The Modem 2 port however works OK at 57600)
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>4.Win-95 side</b></dt><dd> Open your prefered registry editor and make the necesserely
changes to get a MTU=576 :-)
<br>&nbsp;
</dl>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>There is a problem with the pc modem driver in that it needs some
input (anything will do) before it will connect so to get your network
up and running you'll need to:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Double click your new connection icon on the pc.
<br>
</p>
<p>2. Open the Sting Dialer and select &quot;Tools&quot; - &quot;Ping
host&quot;. Enter the pc IP address (192.168.1.2) and
&quot;Okay&quot;.
<br>
</p>
<p>This will open a terminal window on the pc. select the button
&quot;Continue&quot; (or equal.) and your connection will be up.
<br>
</p>
<p>Now you can run standard clients on your pc:s and Atari at the
same time connected to the <a href="15.htm" target="UDOcon">Internet</a> or just ftp localy between the
computers. The ftp server on Peter Rottengatter's (Sting) page works
fine. I have been less successful with aftp as client though. This
runs OK with Geneva+Neodesk on my network: pc+MSTe+Stacy.
<br>
</p>
<p>I have attached the psuedo modem driver (MDMCBX4.ZIP). If any of
you get offended by windows binaries in the group, just remember you
don't have to bother at all with things as stupid as installing
drivers for a standard modem. Hopefully this will cheer you up again
:-)
