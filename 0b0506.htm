<p>As for the Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a> problem, have you tried any other D2D
recording software in Turbo Mode?
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>If not, do try recording and playback with some other software
like the Falcon D2D recorder program that came stock with some Falcons
or some other good D2D recording software that you are fimilar with
and see if you have any problems.
<br>
</p>
<p>One thing about the Falcons SCSI system is that the <a href="030503.htm" target="UDOcon">Timing</a> is very
important. Alot of Falcons do have a problem with the SCSI system even
though no problems ever show up. But when you put in a high
preformance upgrade like the CT2 any problems you have with the SCSI
system are also increased.
<br>
</p>
<p>Also all Falcons are not the same. My SCSI port would not work
correctly with HD Driver or ExtenDos Gold in Turbo Mode with the stock
67 ohm resistor provided in my CT2B package. It took me alot of
testing and etc to find this problem.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The Fix was to simply replace the 67 Ohm resistor with a 100 ohm
resistor which solved the problem.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have problems with other D2D software, then you may also
need to change the 67 Ohm resistor on the SDMA to a 100 Ohm or a value
abit higher than 67 Ohm and see if this solves the problem. Even if
your other D2D software is working correctly it could pay off to
increase the value of the 67 Ohm resistor on the SDMA and see if that
solves the problem with Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a>. From reading your description of
the problem is does sound like a timing problem.
<br>
</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, part of the problem with the Falcons
SCSI system is that some software rely on the timing of signals to
read/write to the SCSI drive(s). When you increase the speed of the
SCSI system with a accelerator, these signals can get out of time.
Probably due to the signals being too fast and this is what causes
problems. If this is the case, then you need to slow down the speed of
the signals abit. Adding a slightly higher resistor value on the SDMA
can bring it all back in time.
<br>
</p>
<p>I don't have Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a>, so I can't really test it. But so far I
haven't had any problems with software after I replaced the 67 Ohm
resistor with a 100 Ohm. And all the D2D software I have tried works
just fine in Turbo Mode.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you do find a solution to this problem, I'd appreciate it if
you would post or e-mail the fix for it.
