*  Quickcam Hardware Installation on Falcon

Some pins are missing in the standard Falcon Parallel Port.
So a simple adapter mixing Falcon Parallel and Paddle B pins is needed.
This adapter is just a very simple wiring...
No parts are needed, only plugs if you want to cleanly solder wires !

        5V power supply


See Below how to connect the male DB25 of the quickcam
to the female DB25 of parallel port and the female DB15 of the paddleB port.
Be careful to read the plugs pinout from the correct sides.

See below how to supply power to the quickcam big keyboard port,
you should bring power from Falcon power supply to a female Keyboard port.
Be very careful to read the plug pinout from the correct side.

When ready, verify once more the wiring, start computer and verify heat.
Launch XY QCAM, it should now detect the quickcam (mine is version #1004).
If you get a "not found" message, your wiring is incorrect !
Check the difference between the end-of-line and #17,
a number may indicate a mismatch with pins /ACK /BUSY PE SELECT.
A #00 or #FF may indicate a mistake with pins DATAx,ERROR,SELECTIN.
If you have any trouble, please send me a mail describing your adapter,
your system and the messages XY QCAM prints to    john.diot@free.fr
If you get your quickcam working, i'll also be glad to receive news...

Good luck !
