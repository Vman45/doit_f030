[2]  DESCRIPTION

XY QCAM is a graphical driver using a Connectix Quickcam Color camera
plugged in the parallel port of a Atari Falcon 030 through a simple adapter.
It can save still pictures or continuous video (in 24bits Targa format).
It manages most of the quickcam parameters and computes brightness level.
It has advanced features such as motion detection and tracking
or videotransmission using serial lines and modem or minitel display.
It only works with the old Connectix Quickcam Color (1 or 2) parallel.
It still doesn't work with the newer Logitech cameras:
  Quikcam VC , Quickcam Home or Web , Quickcam Pro , Quickcam Express
Support for Creative WEBCAM 2 and ROM-Port parallel Adapters is planned.

Files included in package:
  XYQCAM.PRG    The Program
  XYQCPLUG.TXT  The Adapter Installation on Falcon Documentation
  XYQCAM.TXT    This file


[3]  HOW TO USE IT

Launch XYQCAM.PRG from your desktop.
The program sets a new video mode, so avoid Multitasking systems and NVDI.

The driver will look for a Quickcam Color connected through the adapter.
If the program display a "not found" message, check the adapter wiring.
The program should display a "connected" message with camera version number.
If no camera is detected, only remote view or testing is possible (TT030).

The driver will then grab a few frames to compute the best brightness level.
The keyboard help and the parameters are then displayed.
The parameters are set to Zoom Out 160x120 and Automatic Brightness.

To refresh the frame, press [Space] for Single or [.] for Continuous Refresh.
To zoom in a particular area of the sensor (not available with 320x240),
select the area with the numeric keypad:  [7][8][9]
             (5 is center of the sensor)  [4][5][6]
or press [0] to zoom out again.            [1][2][3]
To get 80x60 pixels frames (faster), press [(].
To get 160x120 pixels frames (normal), press [)].
To get 320x240 pixels frames (bigger), press [/].
         
To manually increase the brightness (picture too dark), press [+].
To manually decrease the brightness (picture too bright), press [-].
To adjust once brightness and black level, press [q].
To set/reset Automatic Brightness, press [a].
To manually adjust the black level, use [B] and [b].
To manually adjust the white level, use [W] and [w].
To manually adjust the hue (color balance), use [H] and [h].

To activate/desactivate Separate Pictures saving, press [s],
every new frames will be saved in Targa 24bits as filenames QCAMxxxx.TGA
(each picture is saved with a Targa comment showing Date and Time).
To activate a continuous Video recording, press [Return] or [Enter],
every frames will be streamed in Targa video as filename QCVIDEO.TGA
(Targa video is a big file containing queued Targa 24bits normal pictures,
 it can be used with XY View or by splitting it into single pictures files).

By default, frames are grabbed at maximum speed (depends on brightness),
but you can adjust the time delay between each frames with [T] and [t].

The program has special Delta Modes which manage picture changes,
you can change of Delta Mode by pressing [d].
Diff Mode will display on screen the gradient of pixels between pictures.
Move Mode will display only the pixels that have moved between two pictures.
(activated in these modes, video will only record pictures that changed)
Seek Mode will display pixels that moved and the center of motion(target).
(activated in this mode, video will zoom on motions each 10 from 320x240)
Alarm Mode (press [D]) is a Seek Mode that beeps when motion is detected.
 
The program can display the frame as text (press [y]).
To enable Minitel Mode, press [y], the modem will wait for an incoming call
from a remote minitel (french terminal) and display the text on it.
(the modem should be connected to port modem2 on Falcon or Serial2 on TT)
(it should be more or less compatible with the US Robotics command set)

The program can also send and receive frames to/from a remote computer
(realtime videotransmission) using serial lines or two modems.
Press [m] to activate Modem Mode.
If you are using simple serial lines, type [l]+[Return].
To call a remote computer, enter the phone number.
To wait for a call from a remote computer, just type [Return].
Once the connection is established, frames will be transmitted in 80x60x8b.
To Hang Up, quit the program and switch off the modem.
If you want more features such as videoconference, please send me a mail...
(the modem should be connected to port modem2 on Falcon or Serial2 on TT)
(it should be more or less compatible with the US Robotics command set)

To quit the program, press [Escape]
