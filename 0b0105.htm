Some Commonly Asked Questions:
------------------------------

Q: Will the Barracuda 040 fit in my stock Falcon case?
A: No, because of the limited power supply included with the
   Falcon 030, as well as space restrictions, the user will need to
   use an alternate mounting enclosure with larger power
   supply.

Q: Is the Barracuda compatible with my existing software?
A: Yes the Barracuda is 100% backwards compatible with all
   current software packages.

Q: Are there many problems with the Falcon's DSP?
A: NO, Extensive testing has been done to assure proper
   operation with the internal DSP, all timing associated with the
   DSP will now be handled by the Barracuda 040.

Q: Can I install the Barracuda 040 myself?
A: Yes, although some technical knowledge will be necassary,
   the installation has been mad fairly simple, some soldering will
   be required.

Q: What do I need to know about the RAM option?
A: The RAM card supports from 1 Megabyte to 128 Megabyte of
   local RAM, (TT compatible). The only restriction placed on you,
   is all 8 banks of memory must be occupied by memory of
   the same type. E.G. If bank on uses a 1 Megabyte
   SIMM, then the entire board will need to use the 1 Megabyte SIMMs,
   giving you a total of 8 Megabyte of local RAM. 4 Megabyte
   SIMMs will give you 32 Megabyte, and 16 Megabyte SIMMs 128
   Megabyte.

Q: What about RAM speed?
A: 60 to 70 ns is recommended.

Q: Does the extra RAM help system performance?
A: Yes, local RAM increases system performance greatly.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The Hawk Accelerator is coming

As development continues we now have a target date for the release of the
Hawk Suggested Retail $599.00 and falling

February 02 1997-- The Hawk Accelerator is expected to reach the shelves by
the middle of May with many new changes.

A bit of Bad History

The long history of our Accelerators have not been the pretty picture all
manufactures would like, it started in 1993 with the Barracuda 040, even
after we completed this tedious project we encountered many problems with
the TOS operating system. Wizztronics finally gave in to the pressures and
started a simpler task of an very fast 68030 50MHz accelerator, now it gets
interesting. Once the main unit was completed successfully we decided to
make it hard on our selves again, how ? we added 32 bit access, now since
the Atari Falcon030 is only a 16 bit computer (32 bit processor) it was not
designed to handle the new 32 bit architecture. We were left with the task
of fooling the Propriety chipset into thinking we were not doing what we
were doing. confusing, well it was to us not to mention the Atari Chipset.
It took 11 long months to solve many of the problems, The main reason is
Atari Corp. could offer little help in the technicalities of the chipset.
Sometime in November we had a working proto type and decided to once again
make it hard on ourselves, (to the users benefit of course) Why not reduce
the part count on our PCB, saves the customer money, so it seemed like a
good idea. Logic does not always work as well in a smaller package, as a
mater of fact, the biggest problem we had was the high failure rate amongst
the Custom IC on our board. Now let me sum things up. (!nl)

The Good News

The new Hawk is scheduled for BETA release on March 21st, at that time if
all changes work as planned production will start the following week
allowing 6 weeks for production that puts release dates into the middle of
May. We will post the success or (failure not likely this time no more
changes) as soon as it's completed. At that time, we will start taking
orders from end users as well as several (not all) Dealers and distributors.

Some Specs:

Microprocessor Motorola 68030 50MHz

Bus 32 Bit

Socket for optional 68882 50MHz CO-Processor

Socket for 1 72 pin Simm on board, and a through port for anyone with an
existing memory board Factory or third party.

Memory expansion slot for up to 64 Megabyte of Fast Ram (Optional) if
ordered with the Hawk only $75.00

Speed Enhancement nominal 350% increase of performance up-to 500% on
specialized well optimized code.

100% code compatible with existing software

32 Bit Flash ROM's on board (more speed) and easy OS upgrades beyond 4.04
