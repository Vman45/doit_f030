<p>I open my mailbox the real one, you know, the one we used to use
when email did not exist yet. Anyway, a package from CENTEK is there.
All happy, I really can't wait to open that up. Ahhh the object of all
dreams, finally here in front of my eyes. The Centurbo II is very nice
looking, very professional, quite big, yet I see that it will fit into
the falcon case. A floppy disk is included as well, a nice translucid
sticker saying &quot;POWERED BY CENTEK&quot; to put on my tower (nice
touch) and a small printed installation documentation.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Time to torture my falcon </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>I read the doc VERY carefully as I will be the one attempting the
installation. (My documentation was in french, but english manuals are
available too, specify which language you want your manual in.)
<br>
</p>
<p>Sounds confusing at first.
<br>Need to read a couple more times. Time to hack. Everything becomes
clear and easy as you follow the documentation. Two points weren't
very clear, so I had to use my judgment to determine the pin numbers
which were not drawn on the documentation. I am sure experienced
people will find the installation very easy and simple. Just think
about it, we just need to install it, so imagine the guy who created
it. Anyway some three hours later, I know I am slow, but I
double-checked every steps with a ohmeter and taking my time with the
quality of my soldering.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Time to test </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Low mode is used to see if at least the falcon in original mode
but with CT2 fitted would still work. It works. It makes me confident,
switch it off, push the switch into HIGH mode, turn the machine ON, it
doesn't work. Hmm switch it off, retest everything, but everything
looks correct. Oh maybe one of my old hack I did on my falcon are
interfering with the CT2 which the installation was based on a
STANDARD falcon, not hacked already. Ok cool, lemme try to put back my
old modifications like it used to be when I first got the falcon. Try
again, same result. In HIGH mode the computer is up, the drive spins,
the LEDs are lit, but my SVGA doesn't receive anything, it stays black
with the LED blinking, like no SYNC. Weird... Well I am gonna email
CENTEK to report the problem I have. Until then I still can use my
falcon in LOW mode.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Few days go by </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>I can say now that the LOW mode of the ct2 (supposedly to be 100%
compatible with the original falcon) is actually 100% the falcon. Same
slowness, same bug, same video, same RAM, same crash, same
compatibility. Received email from CENTEK, double checking with me the
important points that I might have forgotten, or messed up. Nothing
showed up to be wrong. CENTEK ask me if I had an oscilloscope, in
which case they could have exactly determined (thru email) what the
problem was. Still, they are doubting because the CT2 I got from them
was tested and showed to be good before sending it to me. I don't have
an oscilloscope, so they trusted me by sending me another CT2 card
(very professional I must admit at this point).
<br>Here is a hand drawing of my ct2 install when I wasn't sure
because of the missing pictures in documentation.

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Who would have thunk? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Someone on IRC had a CT2 (up and working perfectly). He tried to
help me as much as he could, by testing things, trying this, remove
that etc. Until he came up with the idea of unplugging the keyboard.
But HEY! my keyboard is NOT 100% Falcon!!! I did modify it!. not a
whole lot though, I just took the original falcon keyboard, placed it
in a case, and extended the cables. However I know that I didn't use
all the wires. just the ones that seemed important, and since it
worked for years, I thought it was perfectly good. Anyway I try
without the keyboard and guess what, YES IT WORKS!. Now, don't ask me
to explain why my keyboard with missing wires works in LOW mode but
NOT at all in HIGH mode, coz I won't be able to answer.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> The feel bad moment </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Quick, contact CENTEK to cancel the other CT2 they were gonna send
me, not needed anymore as mine WORKS. Ok, CENTEK cancels the new CT2,
cool.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> The feel good moment </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Ok! Time to seriously test this beast.
<br>The LOW mode, that's ok I know it now, I have been using it for 4
days without any problem.
<br>The HIGH mode. First thing that appears on the screen is a blue
background with options, like BIOS menu on PC. From there, you can
select things like the OS that you gonna be using, the driver for your
drives, some backward compatibility options such as waitstates on
IDE/DSP. No speed selection. On the CT2, it's either FULL SPEED, or
100% original falcon, which is a concept I like, though it might not
seem flexible, but if the card is done correctly, 50Mhz should be the
only real solution.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Hypothetical world </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great to have a perfect mix between the FALCON and
the TT?
<br>Like a TT with a videl chip for better video, with DSP and audio
capabilities of the FALCON, IDE port, newer TOS version etc.
<br>Well the CT2 is all that but in even better. Your falcon with a
CT2 is basically twice faster than a TT (if not more actually, but x2
for sure). With faster BUS than TT (25Mhz as opposed to 16mhz) and
FASTRAM accessed on CT2 at 50Mhz instead of 32Mhz on TT. Your Falcon
is now a true 32Bit machine all 50Mhz except the STram. The Videl is
faster, giving you a smooth 640*480 16 bit mode (probably higher, I
didn't try higher yet) or some extended resolution very comfortable at
a good frequency, no flickering or such. GEMDEMO 0.04 on SVGA videl
72FPS in <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a>. The DSP is faster, the FPU is faster as well and of
course the CPU is also faster at 50Mhz. Basically with a Falcon/CT2
you get a true 32bit 50Mhz machine.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> What does that really mean for me </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Basically FAST, SMOOTH, STABLE and COMPATIBLE. Working in 800*606
256 colors is not a pain anymore. Multitasking becomes a breeze. never
running out of memory anymore with those 32Meg EDO ram. As some of you
might know I am a <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a> freak, the fact that the CT2 upgrades the TOS
version up to TOS 7.04, I had some problems with <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a> 1.15 which
checked TOS version. Frank Nauman did a patch for me in order to
locate the problem I was having. It all works now. So stay tuned for a
more generic fix in <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a> or CT2 TOS.
<br>HDdriver has problems with IDE port. Uwe Seimet (hddriver author)
and CENTEK are aware. I use CECILE right now, which even works with
MINIX partitions. No prob seen so far. (CECILE is included in the CT2
package).
<br>All GEM programs basically will work. MANY NON-GEM programs will
also work. I have had the chance to test Rainbow II (graphic art
package), APEX Media, Speed o'light, Da's Vector, Da's Layout, Calamus
SL, some atari ST games, some falcon games, etc etc..(I am not gonna
list everything I have tested it would be WAY too long.) VERY VERY
good compatibility.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Things to know </b>
<br><b> ST-ram </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>My gizmo 14meg card that I used to use as STram can't work with
the CT2, way too slow. I have heard that the Wizztronic RAM card
worked and so is the CENTRAM. As general rule I would say, as long as
your extended 16Meg RAM card is 1 module 72pin. It will most likely
work, granted the speed of the SIMMS itself, should be at least 70ns
(to be confirmed about the speed).
<br><b> FAST-ram </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>I went to a computer shop and just asked for a &quot;72pin 32meg
EDO 60ns ram&quot; , they sold it to me for 39 USD. Plugged it in, and
works like a charm.
<br><b> IDE </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The CT2 will GREATLY improve your IDE port. Up to 8.x meg/sec with
some good drives. Be careful with the disk driver you are using,
Hddriver shows some problems with IDE. I know HDdriver will be fixed
for the CT2, I just don't know when.
<br><b> Serial port </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Well I first had many problems with my serial port with the CT2,
dropped packets, slow speed. But then CENTEK also found the problem
and released a patch for HSMODEM which was seeing the SCC chip being
at 14Mhz which is not. Just the way HSMODEM detected the type/speed of
your SCC chip is not accurate, and will fail if you install a CT2. The
patch given by CENTEK is just to force HSMODEM to recognized the SCC
at the correct speed. Since then, no problem.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> After all </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Well after all the Centurbo II card is ONE HELL of a card. Very
fast, reliable, compatible.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Pros </b>
<br>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Speed beyond what thought to be possible on a 030 CPU.
<br>All tests, benches are on CENTEK pages, I won't comment them or
make some more tests as I get the same speed as on their page.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> No messing around with speeds, caches settings.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Extremely compatible, I was very surprised. Atari hardware and
acceleration don't go together generally.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> No hiden tricks like on nemesis, FX or AB40 cards, such as
printing impossible on high speed on nemesis, or 90% of the time the
AB40 needs to have the caches OFF to remain somewhat compatible, and
such. I have to say that this CT2 is always at 50Mhz and don't see so
far any need to switch it to original speed. Everything works. And if
something doesn't like TOS 7.04 or FASTRAM or whatever, I still boot
in 50Mhz but with TOS 4.04.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> The setup with FLASHROM. Comes with the FLASH-writer software so
I already upgraded the Boot twice now. Always getting better and
better.. (CECILE now works with minix for example)
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> The temperature of the CT2 is WONDERFULL, a BIG heat dissipator
glued on the new 030 CPU + an extra fan on the top. It ran for more
than 15 hours 2 days ago at full speed, no crash, NOT even hot. Tell
me that it is quite good! The SYL &quot;Lattice&quot; thingy controler
is a bit hot, but I guess it's ok as I can leave my finger on it
without getting burned. So I guess this temperature is quite allright.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> The CT2 fixes efficiently the falcon original problems such as
the cracks and pops in the audio, or SCSI transfers being corrupted.
There was many patches available for these, but many didn't work, or
work on one machine but not on another.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Centscreen is a very nice program. Latest version fixed all the
problems I had with earlier versions.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> The service quality I have gotten from them was very good.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> The price, for 380USD you can't beat that really. And yes the
milan seems nice. But it is NOT an option to me, milan doesn't have
DSP chip, the audio of falcon, (for example, no Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a>), no
backward compatibility for games/demo etc.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Easy installation.
<br>&nbsp;
</dl>
<p><b> Cons </b>
<br>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Not enough documentation about what's happening. What's TOS 7.04
exactly? In example what are the new cookies installed by the CT2?
their structures?
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Where do I steadily place my internal IDE? that's one problem, I
can't screw it in like it was because of the CT2. The original holes
on the motherboard for the IDE can't be used. The drive fits into the
case, but not fixed, so remind me to NOT shake my falcon.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Dolmen not included yet. (it is said to be out end November)
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> CECILE doesn't seem to support the XHDI protocol.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> The lack of drawing in the installation documentation.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Couldn't find where to order a CT2 in the USA. (heard a rumour
that Best Electronics imports the CT2 card).
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>-</b></dt><dd> Long installation, took 3 hours to do it here myself.
<br>&nbsp;
