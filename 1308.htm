<dl>
<dt><b>METADOS</b></dt><dd> was made by Atari, over the years many people have upgraded it
and now it is the standard and supported by ALL OS. METADOS comes with
two drivers; *.DOS and *.BOS, a small config file tells METADOS where
the drivers can be found, on what port the CDROM is connected and what
drive letter should be assigned to it. It sounds more complicated then
it is, just a little bit logical thinking.... MetaDOS is freeware Take
the latest release 2.70 from Julian Reschke
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>EXTENDOS</b></dt><dd> is a commercial CDROM driver, installation is very simple and it
supports nearly all drives. There is a program incuded with wich one
can play Music CD's. EXTENDOS GOLD is a commercial CD ROM and Writer
Driver, installation is also easy. Both these programs are well suited
for people who can't be bothered/know nothing about config.files
etc... I'm not sure if it runs/supports all OS.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>EGON CD Utilities</b></dt><dd> is also a commercial program, it's based on METADOS and comes
with its own *.DOS and *.BOS drivers. It runs under all OS and is
compatible with all major applications. Installing it is very simple
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>CD Tools</b></dt><dd> is a commercial program with nearly the same features of EGON.
CD-TOOLS comes from Hard&amp;Soft in germany and is not longer
supported
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>SPIN</b></dt><dd> is a shareware program written by Julian Reschke, when run from
MINT or MAGIC you can read MAC HFS CD's and see/copy files with long
file names. SPIN is the ONLY CD driver wich allows this. Under plain
TOS this packet works equally well. But You lose the benifits of the
long file names and being able to read HFS Files. SPIN is also ideal
to grab music tracks from Music CD's. It saves them as *.WAV files.
When run from MAGIC, NAES/MINT it uses a XFS driver instead of
METADOS.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>BETADOS</b></dt><dd> is compatible with METADOS and ads some goodies like clusters and
compatibility with MAGIC 6.x shared library's. It runs on all OS.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>CD RECORDER PRO</b></dt><dd> is a program for CD Writers, it supports all the major standards,
but also CD rerecordable yet. The program uses METADOS and its own
*.BOS driver. There's no installation program supplied, so you have to
do that yourself. Before bying a CD Writer check the compatibility
list, not all CD Writers are supported.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>CD SOLUTIONS</b></dt><dd> is the same thing as the one above, but for the MILAN clone. This
one can use CD Writers with IDE interface, note that for some bizarre
reason CD RECORDER PRO doesn't work with the SCSI card from the MILAN.

<p>
<br>
<br><b> Connect a CD ROM to your Atari </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>What you need:
<br>
</p>
<p>-SCSI CD ROM
<br>-SCSI to DMA convertor (LINK, ICD etc..)
<br>-One of the programs mentioned above
<br>
</p>
<p>and that's all there is to it, it's just as easy as connecting a
harddisk. BTW: You don't need a harddisk to have a CD ROM connected.
The drivers are so small you can easily boot from disk.
<br>
</p>
<p>When buying a CD ROM don't be blinded by speed, the AHDI/SCSI
interface on all standard Atari's can't sustain more then 1800Kb/sec.
So buying a 32x or 36x speed CD ROM is just waisting money. A 12x
speed is perfect and can be obtained cheaply from PC-Nerds who always
NEED faster drives to run Micro$hit applications -))))
<br>
</p>
<p>A good program to play Music CD's is CD Player from Alexander
Claus, it runs on all OS, has a built in database that keeps track of
your CD's and is it also possible to extract music tracks with it. CD
Player is freeware.
<br>
</p>
<p>On Atari's and clones with a IDE interface You can also connect a
IDE CD ROM, METADOS can handle these with no problems. The advantage
is speed =&gt; 36x at full speed. The disadvantage is that you lose
one of your two possible IDE connections...
<br>
</p>
<p>There's probably a lot I forgot here, but to start with this
should keep you busy -))) and with no doubt there will be a lot more
postings with tips and comments coming in...
